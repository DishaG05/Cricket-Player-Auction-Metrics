🏏 Cricket Player Auction Metrics
👋 Hey there! 
Welcome to my IPL data analytics project, where I dig into one of cricket’s biggest questions: What really drives auction prices for IPL players?

🧐 What Did I Actually Do?
Wrangled IPL data: Cleaned up messy spreadsheets to get everything ready for analysis.
Dove deep with Python: Ran a bunch of exploratory and statistical analyses to see which factors (age, performance, social media, etc.) impact auction prices.
Visualized findings in Tableau: Created dashboards so you can interact with the data, spot undervalued players, and maybe even predict next season’s auction surprises!
Summed up the insights: Wrote short takeaways on what seems to matter most in the IPL auction room.

🛠️ Skills I Used & Learned
Python (Pandas, Numpy, data cleaning & analysis)
Tableau (dashboard building, storytelling with data)
Excel (making raw data useable)
Data visualization (making numbers actually interesting!)
Statistical analysis (finding patterns that matter)
Domain knowledge: Cricket analytics
Communication: Turning insights into stories anyone can understand

📚 How To Explore
Check out the code: Open Code.py to see how I cleaned and analyzed the data.
Play with the dashboards: Download the .twbx files and open them in Tableau Public to interact with the visuals.
Explore the raw data: If you’re into Excel, take a peek at the data file!

🌟 Why I Did This
Mostly, I wanted to combine my love for cricket and data and learn something new along the way. If you’re a fellow cricket fan, data nerd, or just curious about sports analytics, hope you enjoy exploring as much as I did!
